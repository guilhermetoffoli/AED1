Project number two of college of the subject Data structure and algorithms 1, wich includes exercising stacks, queues, statics or linked.

Exercise 1 is about a linked stack of integers, wich the user have three options to convert a positive integer into a binary, octal or hexidecimal base, beeing infinite until the user types a negative number. It haves all the stack functions, such as create a stack, let it empty, erase it, push, pop and read the top.

Exercise 2 is used two data structures, a sequential static stack of chars and a linked stack of floats, both with basic functions. This exercise is about manipulation of math expressions, with different functions such as scope validation, following the order { -> [ 
-> (. Other function is the expression evaluation, wich receives a expression (example: (A+D) * (^C)) and returns if a operator or operand is missing.

Exercise 3 is about a sequential static queue of cars, wich includes number, type of service (loose or monthly) and entry time. Using the basics functions of a queue, the program is used to control the entrys and the exits of cars in a parking lot, composed with these functions: entry of vehicules, exit of vehicules and cenario visualization.

Exercise 4 is about a circular linked priority queue with removal ordered of pacients in a hospital, having name, age, weight, height, type of disease (Cardiac, neurologic, sanguine or respiratory) and the degree of severity (used as priority) 1 to 5.

Exercise 5 is about a double ended queue of maximum 10 strings, containing the basics functions, such as create, erase it, let it empty, if queue is empty, if queue is full, print start to end, print end to start, append on the end, append on the start, remove on the start and remove on the end.
