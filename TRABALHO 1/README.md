# Trabalho 1
Project number 1 of college of the subject Data structure and algorithms 1, wich includes exercising lists, linked or not.
Each one have the basics functions of lists such as, create a list (instantiate), erase it, leave it empty, append, remove and the length, but each one have a peculiar functions due its data type.

Exercise 1 is about a sequential list of chars, using abstract using type, with extra function remove at given position, remove vowel and interleave.

Exercise 2 is about a sequential list of strings, with functions append at a given position, remove minor and concatenate.

Exercise 3 is about a linked list with a header node of floats, with functions remove at given position, comparision and interleave.

Exercise 4 is about a linked list of integers, with remove major, reverse the list and interleave.

Exercise 5 is about a circular linked list of integers, with append at the start, append at the end, remove at the start and the end and remove even.

Exercise 6 is about a double linked lists of doubles, with append at a given position, remove minor, remove all given integer and reverse the list.
